# Playground

A collection of personal learning projects and experiments covering frontend development and generative AI topics.

## Overview

This repository serves as a sandbox for exploring various technologies and concepts, organized into focused areas of study. Each subdirectory contains self-contained projects with their own documentation and setup instructions.

## Repository Structure

### Frontend (`fe/`)

Frontend development projects and experiments.

- **[vue/use-element-plus](fe/vue/use-element-plus)** - Vue 3 application using Element Plus UI framework and Vite
  - Modern Vue 3 setup with TypeScript
  - Element Plus component library integration
  - Hot module replacement for rapid development

### Generative AI (`genai/`)

Machine learning and large language model experiments.

- **[LLMs-from-scratch](genai/LLMs-from-scratch)** - Building a ChatGPT-like LLM in PyTorch from scratch
  - Step-by-step implementation of transformer architecture
  - Based on "Build a Large Language Model from Scratch" by Sebastian Raschka
  - Includes cross-entropy loss implementation and training notebooks
  
- **[dive-into-claude-agent](genai/dive-into-claude-agent)** - Exploring Claude AI agent capabilities
  - Experimental project for understanding AI agents
